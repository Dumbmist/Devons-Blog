#### Game Idea

- This game is going to be a item collecting/spanish learning adventure for the people who will play it.
- The player (computer) will start in a world in "Dora Land" and will move to diffrent places of the the map

#### NPC

1) Our first NPC will be boots, the monkey, and he will just asl a simple question where players click the w key to answer the question in spanish. He will make Dora go to the map.
<br>
2) The second NPC will be the map, the map tell the players that they can find the key to save Rachit on the map
<br>
3) Swiper, swiper will appear on the screen and when the player interacts with him he will steal any items Dora has. This will reset Dora's progress.

#### Game objective

Dora will need to obtain the key and journey back to the chest to free Rachit from the chest. If Dora does not find the key and save rachit in under 5 minutes Rachit will not survive.

(To find the key the q key will need to be pressed on the correct spot to dig.)
(to do this, we will make an invisible npc that can be interacted with only with q)

There will also be a leader board for who can save Rachit the fastest
